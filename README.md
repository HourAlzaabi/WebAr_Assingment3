WebAR Dinosaur Viewer (Mobile AR Project)
ðŸ¦• A mobile-based Web AR experience where users can view and interact with 3D dinosaur models using their device camera and a custom marker. Built with AR.js and A-Frame, it runs directly in the browser â€” no app needed.

ðŸ”§ Main Features
Marker-based AR: Uses a .patt marker to place 3D models in real-world space through the camera.

Four dinosaur species available to view and interact with.

Users can rotate, zoom, and switch models easily through touch gestures.

Long-press gesture toggles between full model and skeleton view.

Each dinosaur has an audio narration in a natural male voice.

Helpful UI includes menu, play/pause button, and help instructions.

Visual cues and animations guide the user experience.

Optimized for mobile phones in landscape mode.
